# weather-app
This is a weather web application that I developed during the third week of the Hofstra University W-SPiCE program.

# Languages Used
• HTML - this markup language was used to create elements, containers, tags, and attributes to display the content and the implement the functionality of certain elements, such as the button to change the forecast layout.

• CSS - this styling language was used to build the layout of the application; the grid layout was used to make the website more responsive and simplifies the placement of each element.

• JavaScript - this scripting language was used to implement the functionality of the application, specifically networking with the weather API that has up-to-date information on the weather forecast.

# Other Tools Used
Visual Studio Code - this lightweight source-code editor was used for debugging, syntax highlighting, extension installation, and version control with Git, which were crucial for the development, execution, and sharing of this applicaation.

[Open-Meteo Weather API]([url](https://api.open-meteo.com)) - this website was used for obtaining real-time weather data based on the user's current location.

Live Server (created by Ritwick Day) - this extension launches a local development server with live reload capabilities that will enable the application to update in real time.

# Upcoming Improvements
1) Changing the icons (partly-cloudy, sunny, raining, etc.) based on the weather forecast.
2) Using the Weather API to update the weekly forecast page.
3) Making the weekly forecast page more responsive by using a different layout than Grid or use the "auto" keyword to automatically change the size of the grid rows/columns according to the size of the webpage tab.
